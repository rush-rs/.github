## Projects Which Are Part of rush

### Paper

Since rush was initiated due to a research project about compiler construction
and different means of program execution, all important concepts are explained
in the rush paper. The project and the paper were developed by
[Mik MÃ¼ller](https://github.com/MikMuellerDev) and
[Silas Groh](https://github.com/RubixDev) at the _CFG Wuppertal_.

An up-to-date version of the rush paper can be viewed at
